üîç Task1: Data Exploration and Summaryüìä

Objective: Understand and summarize key statistics in the dataset.

Steps I followed:

1. Data Import: 
 started by importing the dataset into Power BI to leverage its powerful analytics and visualization capabilities.

2. Exploratory Analysis: 
 Explored the dataset structure and data types to understand the data better. 
This included:
 Reviewing the columns and their respective data types.
 Checking for any missing or inconsistent data.

3. Calculate Statistics: 
 Calculated essential statistics to derive meaningful insights :

1. Average Age: Calculated the average age of our investors.
2. Investment Preferences: 
 Determined the percentage of individuals with various investments, focusing on gold and debentures.
3. Savings Objectives: 
 Identified common savings objectives, such as retirement planning, education, and Health care.
4. Visualization:
 To convey my findings effectively, I created visual representations:
1. Gender Distribution: Highlighted through the Donut chart, revealing a 62.5% male and 37.5% female investor split.
2. Investment Preferences: 
 Bar charts illustrate the popularity of gold and debentures as preferred investment avenues.
3. Savings Objectives: Insights into retirement planning, healthcare, and education savings objectives through comparative bar charts.

Key Insights:
1. Average Age: The average age of our investors is 27.80 years.

2. Investments :
 Total Investment Avenues: 40
 With Investment: 37
 Without Investment: 3

3. Gender Distribution:
Males: 25 individuals (62.5%)
Females: 15 individuals (37.5%)
The majority of the group consists of males, indicating a higher representation compared to females. 

4. Saving Objectives:
Retirement Plan: 24 individuals
Health Care: 13 individuals
Education: 3 individuals
Many prioritize long-term financial security and healthcare, while fewer focus on saving for education

5. Investment Preferences:
Gold: 239 of total investments
Debentures: 230 of total investments
Investing in gold indicates a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation, while debentures show a preference for fixed-income securities.

Overall Summary:

The data shows a focus on long-term financial stability and healthcare, with less attention to education savings. Investments in gold and debentures suggest a preference for stability and fixed-income securities in an uncertain economy.

Task2: Gender-based Analysis:

Objective: Analyze and visualize gender-based differences in investment preferences.

Steps:

1.üîç Visual Comparison:
 I created charts to compare investment choices (equity, mutual funds, government bonds) based on gender.

 1.Gender-based choices on various investments:
 Clustered Bar chart
 2.No.of male and female investors in each investment category.
 Stacked Column chart
 3.Gender Distribution by Avenues

 4.Investment avenues Investment monitor and Gender:

2.üìäKey Insights:

 1.The average age of investors is 27.8 years.

 2.There are 37 different investment avenues analyzed, with 3 categories showing no investment.

3. Government Bonds:
Male: 121 investments
Female: 65 investments

Observation: Males have a significantly higher preference for Government Bonds compared to females.

Mutual Funds:
Male: 61 investments
Female: 41 investments

Observation: The number of investments in Mutual Funds is nearly equal between males and females, with males having a slightly higher count.

Equity Market:
Male: 89 investments
Female: 50 investments

Observation: Males have a higher count of investments in the Equity Market compared to females.

5. The pie chart indicates that 62.5% of investments are made by male investors whereas 37.5% are female investors.

6. Investment monitoring frequency shows that Males prefer to monitor their investments monthly, much more than females. Weekly monitoring is also mostly done by males, with few females participating. 

Interestingly, daily monitoring is more popular among male investors, with no females choosing this option.
